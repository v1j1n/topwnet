# Contact Page Implementation Summary

## Overview
The contact page has been made fully dynamic and functional with AJAX form submission, following the same patterns used in the existing enquiry form on the homepage.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Components

#### ContactController (`app/Http/Controllers/ContactController.php`)
- **index()**: Displays the contact page
- **submit()**: Handles form submission with validation, honeypot protection, and email notifications
- Returns JSON for AJAX requests, redirects for regular form submissions

#### StoreContactEnquiryRequest (`app/Http/Requests/StoreContactEnquiryRequest.php`)
- Validates all form fields (name, email, phone, subject, message)
- Subject field is optional
- Custom error messages for better UX

#### ContactEnquiry Model Updates
- Added `subject` field to fillable attributes
- Migration created to add subject column to database

### 2. Frontend Components

#### Dynamic Contact Page (`resources/views/pages/contact.blade.php`)
- Uses `$siteSettings` object (globally shared via middleware)
- Displays dynamic contact information:
  - Address
  - Email addresses (from array)
  - Phone numbers (from array)
  - Embedded Google Map (dynamic URL from settings)
- Contact form with honeypot protection
- Fields: name, email, phone, subject (optional), message

#### AJAX Form Handler (`public/js/contact-page-ajax.js`)
- Prevents page reload on form submission
- Shows loading state during submission
- Displays success/error messages dynamically
- Handles validation errors gracefully
- Auto-hides success messages after 5 seconds
- Form resets after successful submission

### 3. Routes (`routes/web.php`)
- **GET /contact**: Displays contact page
- **POST /contact**: Handles form submission with honeypot middleware protection

### 4. Database
- Migration: `2025_10_31_093820_add_subject_to_contact_enquiries_table.php`
- Adds nullable `subject` column to `contact_enquiries` table

### 5. Email Notifications
- Reuses existing email infrastructure from Enquiry form
- Sends to admin email configured in `config/mail.admin_email`
- Supports both PHP mail() and SMTP based on configuration
